  (** [run_outside_async f] is the idiomatic way to call functions [f] where [f] only
      wraps a single call into Elisp, and [f] would otherwise raise {[

        "Called [block_on_async] in the middle of an Async job!"

      ]}.

      [f] should do nothing but make the one call into elisp, unless you can show that the
      work done in OCaml is safe to run with pre-emptive multi-threading semantics.

      [run_outside_async f] schedules [f] to run at some point in the future, outside of
      Async, i.e. not during an Async cycle and without holding the Async lock.

      This is necessary so that Emacs will run timers and network handlers while waiting
      for [f], and hence will request and run the Async cycles needed by [f]. *)
