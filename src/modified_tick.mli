(** A [Modified_tick.t] is an integer value of one of the two modification counters that
    Emacs maintains for each buffer:

    - [buffer-modified-tick], which increments every time a buffer is modified.
    - [buffer-chars-modified-tick], which increments every time characters are inserted or
      deleted in the buffer.
