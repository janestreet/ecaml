(** The "advice" feature lets you add to the existing definition of a function, by
    wrapping around the original function a "piece of advice".

    Each piece of advice receives the original function and arguments; its result is
    returned to the caller as if from the original function.

    A function may have multiple pieces of advice, which are composed by nesting earlier
    advice within later advice.

    If async advice is added to an elisp function, that function must be called with
    [run_outside_async] or it will raise at runtime. This cannot be detected at compile
    time because one can add advice at runtime.
