(* We don't want to capture, e.g., the test directory, which is a jenga sandbox tempdir,
   or the command line arguments to the test runner, which depend on user config.

   It's okay for us to mangle the backtrace quite badly in tests, since we only need to
   prove that we're getting back the thing emacs calls a backtrace.
