(** The C code arranges to call [end_of_module_initialization] at the end of
    [emacs_module_init], which is what Emacs calls to initialize an Ecaml plugin. This is
    after all the other top-level OCaml code has run.

    [on_end_of_module_initialization] adds a function to be run during
    [end_of_module_initialization]. That function is called without holding the Async
    scheduler lock. *)

(** [free_embedded_caml_values] removes entries for any embeded ocaml values that are not
    longer used in emacs and are scheduled to be removed. The function runs whenever we
    enter OCaml from emacs, provided of course that there are values to collect. *)

(** [report_exn_when_calling_callback] is called when the infrastructure that calls a
    callbacks raises. This is a rare situation, e.g. [Out_of_memory]. *)
